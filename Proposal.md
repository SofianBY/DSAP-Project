# Investment Strategies Based on Market Regimes  

## Project Category  
**Data Science / Machine Learning applied to Finance**

---

## Problem Statement and Motivation  
Financial markets alternate between regimes such as high volatility, strong trends, or corrections.  
Traditional strategies — **buy-and-hold**, **momentum**, and **mean reversion** — perform differently under these conditions but are usually applied in a static way.  

This project aims to build a **machine learning model** that identifies market regimes and predicts **which investment strategy is likely to perform best over the following month**.  
The system will then adapt dynamically, switching between strategies based on predicted conditions.  

As someone passionate about finance, this project is an opportunity to apply quantitative methods to portfolio management and explore how machine learning can complement traditional financial logic.

## Planned Approach and Technologies  
Implementation will be in **Python 3.11** with a clear, modular, and reproducible structure.  

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation  
- Retrieve historical index or ETF data using *yfinance*.  
- Compute indicators such as volatility, RSI, MACD, SMA, and inter-asset correlations.  

### 2. Feature Engineering and Labeling  
- Build features describing volatility regimes, trends, correlations, and macro variables (e.g., VIX, interest rates).  
- Define the **target label** as the strategy (momentum, mean reversion, or buy-and-hold) that achieved the **highest return in the following month**.  
- The monthly horizon offers a good trade-off between sample size and meaningful performance differences.  

### 3. Modeling  
- Train and compare **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting** models.  
- Use **time-series cross-validation** to avoid look-ahead bias.  

### 4. Dynamic Backtesting  
- Apply model predictions to select strategies dynamically.  
- Compare the adaptive portfolio with static benchmarks using **cumulative return**, **volatility**, and **Sharpe ratio**.

## Expected Challenges  
- **Overfitting:** controlled via regularization and time-based validation.  
- **Noisy data:** mitigated by smoothing indicators and selecting robust features.  
- **Interpretability:** improved through feature importance analysis.  
- **Market efficiency:** acknowledged as a limiting factor — the goal is not necessarily to outperform dramatically, but to **understand when each strategy tends to work best**.  

---

## Success Criteria  
The project will be considered successful if:  
- The ML model shows **modest but consistent improvements** over static strategies or provides **insightful regime classifications**.  
- Results are reproducible and clearly visualized.  
- The code follows sound structure and documentation standards.  

---

## Stretch Goals  
- Extend to multiple asset classes (bonds, crypto).  
- Build a simple **Streamlit dashboard** to visualize market regimes and strategy shifts in real time.

## Summary  
**Finsight** explores how machine learning can enhance investment decision-making by adapting strategy selection to changing market regimes.  
Rather than seeking dramatic outperformance, the focus is on learning *when and why* each strategy performs best — bridging traditional financial intuition with data-driven insights.
